Leigh takes charge of the day-to-day running of both Take 10 and Do Some Good. Having watched and supported the Trust’s journey with Clint since its conception, it’s exciting for Leigh to be on board. 

Knowing VSCT is making a real impact in the lives of young kiwis, is what excites Leigh. There isn’t anything better than seeing a smile on a kids face and knowing you help put it there. ​Leigh has a 7-year daughter and a 15-year-old step son who lives in South Africa.
