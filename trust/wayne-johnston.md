Wayne has spent the greater part of his working years in the corporate world as Vice President Sales Australasia for Goodyear Dunlop based in Melbourne. Wayne is a family man – father of two and grandfather of three. Since 2008 he has turned his business acumen to the running of three major whānau-owned businesses.

​Wayne is Chairman of the <a href="https://www.teawe.maori.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Te Awe Board</a> because he wants to give something back to the Māori world that he is a part of. The VSCT is lucky to have a man of Wayne’s calibre and experience who is willing to give some of his valuable time and experience to helping others.
