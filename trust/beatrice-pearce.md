Bea is in charge of Take 10 Arvo’s and provides support for the other projects. Bea started with the Trust in February 2021 and is making the Arvo’s her own.  Planning activities such as hip hop classes, skateboard sessions, and painting are some of the fun things she has organised so far. She has already gathered a group of tamariki who turn up every week to see her and enjoy the Arvo’s.

Bea is an easy-going, chatty individual who loves to gather ideas and kick-start new projects. She is into music, animals, art, and socialising. She is always willing to give something a go and a huge supporter of new ideas.
