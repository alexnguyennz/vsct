                <p>For those who may need a break from drinking, need help, or just want a break, we provide a safe place to “take 10”. They can hang out, have some water, charge their phone to stay in touch with friends and family, get medical help, refuge, and advice from our fully trained team leaders and volunteers.</p>

        <p>What makes Take 10 different?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Preventative</strong> – we catch people before they become victims by stopping them from becoming isolated, and helping to reconnect people.</li>
            <li><strong>Approach-able</strong> – people are often more willing to come to us than the police or emergency services</li>
            <li><strong>Safe</strong> – we give people a place to go where they can sober up, rather than putting themselves at risk</li>
