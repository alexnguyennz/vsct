testimonialName: Hamish Knight, Sergeant at Wellington Metro Police
testimonialDescription: The Take 10 pilot outside of the St. James Theatre brought a positive atmosphere to the Wellington nightlife among Courtenay Place on Friday and Saturday nights. Staff were engaging and professional with the public, they made me feel welcome and always encouraged me to get involved handing out water or lollies. I would like to see Take 10 become a permanent fixture in Wellington.
