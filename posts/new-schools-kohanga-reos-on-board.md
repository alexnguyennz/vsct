Itâ€™s been a busy time for Do Some Good! Thanks to the generosity and support of the Wellington City Council and the latest Social and Recreation Funding round we have welcomed three new schools (Tawa Intermediate School, Berhampore School, and St Anneâ€™s School) and two Kohanga Reoâ€™s (Te Iwi Kohanga Reo, Linden and Ngahauranga Kohanga Reo in Hampton Hill) to the School Lunch Project.

We are proud to be adding these schools and Kohanga Reoâ€™s to our Do Some Good list.

This generous funding will enable us to provide healthy, nutritional lunches to tamariki each school day to support their wellbeing and learning. Do Some Good believes every child deserves the opportunity to be the very best they can be â€“ and we know tamariki learn better with full tummies.

Our School Lunch Project ultimately aims to assist early tamariki development, improve community resilience and promote neighbourhood connections.

Huge thanks to Wellington City Council for making this happen. ðŸ˜Š
