Over the last few weeks the Do Some Good team has been out in the community delivering food bags to whanau from our partner schools. After Alert Level 4 was in place, we spoke with the principals of our five schools to see if anyone needed support. They all said the same thing â€“ our community is hurting right now.

In the first week, we delivered over 50 bags, in the second week we delivered 130 bags, and this week we will deliver over 140 bags. We will continue to deliver bags to whanau during Alert Level 3. We are grateful to have a small, but a fantastic team of volunteers giving up their weekends to pack and deliver the bags. All while social distancing and remaining within our own bubbles. :)
