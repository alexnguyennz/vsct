Like many other organisations right now Take 10 has temporarily stopped operating due to Alert level 4 restrictions. We are doing our part to keep people safe by self-isolating.

We look forward to being back up and running on Courtenay Place as soon as it is safe to do so. In the meantime keep yourself and those around you safe, be patient and kind. :)
